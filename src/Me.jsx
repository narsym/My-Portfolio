                    <p>Hi, My name is Narasimha Vennelaganti. I love exploring and learning new things. I experiment a lot to do anything.
                    And did I say I am a good Cook ;)
                    </p>
                    <p>I love making applications in Mern Stack. Creating beautiful UI excites me more than anything. 
                    I also love ML and DL. I have created a lot of applications in them. I love making web sites which use these technologies.
                    </p>
